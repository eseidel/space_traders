# Space Traders in Dart

A Dart client for spacetraders.io.

## Packages
* [cli](packages/cli) - The main CLI for "playing" the game.
* [db](packages/db) - Postgres bindings for storing client state.
* [openapi](packages/openapi) - A generated Dart client for the Space Traders API.
* [server](packages/server) - A very basic server for supporting the UI.
* [types](packages/types) - Shared types between the packages.
* [ui](packages/ui) - A Flutter UI for the Space Traders API.

`cli`, `db` and `types` are the most complete and useful packages.
`openapi` is generated (and pretty terrible code).
`server` and `ui` are mostly stubs.

## Setup

This requires Dart 3.0.0 or later.

The easiest way to get Dart is typically via Flutter.  See
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install for instructions.

On ubuntu:
```
sudo snap install flutter --classic
```

If you're running this in a docker container, or otherwise as root Dart and
Flutter will print a warning about running as root.  You can ignore it or
disable it with:
```
export BOT=true
```

## Usage

The client originally ran as a single program using JSON files for state.
At this time it's been partially refactored to use a Postgres database for
state.  Thus you need to run the database server first.

### Database

See instructions in packages/db/README.md.

Note: currently our notify/listen code seems to cause a leak on the server
side of the connection.  Thus you may need to restart both the cli and
network executor every 12 hours or so, depending on how much RAM you have.

I run the cli, db and network executor all in the same instance which has
4GB of RAM.  I typically restart the cli and network executor every 12 hours.

### Network Executor

The network executor is the rate limited client for the Space Traders API.
It's a separate process to allow us to eventually have multiple clients
running at once.

The CLI does not *require* the network executor (it knows how to do)
in process rate limiting, but it's recommended if you plan to be running
things for long periods of time.

I typically run the network executor in a separate terminal window or tmux
or screen session.  e.g.

```
screen -S net
cd packages/cli
dart run bin/network_executor.dart
```

### CLI

The CLI is the main way to play the game.  It's a single process that
handles all the game logic and logging.  It does require user input
to register, but after that it can run unattended.

Similar to the network executor, I typically run the CLI in a separate
terminal window or tmux or screen session.  e.g.

```
screen -S cli
cd packages/cli
dart run
```

### cli bin/ directory

There are a variety of scripts I've written in packages/cli/bin which can be
used to query the database, or do other things.  They're not documented
yet, but you can see what they do by reading the source.  I've tried to
sort them by area of interest.

Most scripts run completely on cached data, but the ones which do talk to
the API are smart enough to use the db and network executor if available
otherwise they will use the API directly via an in-process rate limiter.

## Development

### Testing

You can run individual packages tests locally by cd'ing into the package
directory and running `dart test`.

There are also tools like `very_good` which can run tests across multiple
packages, e.g. `dart pub global activate very_good_cli`
then `very_good test -r`.

### Coverage

I've slowly been adding tests and increasing coverage.  See
[codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/eseidel/space_traders) for the current
coverage.

You can run all the tests locally and collect coverage by running
`./coverage.sh`.  This will run all the tests and generate a coverage
report in `coverage/lcov.info`.  You can then view the coverage report
by running `genhtml coverage/lcov.info` (on linux) and opening the
generated `index.html` file in your browser.  There are also a variety
of other tools for viewing lcov.info files, including extensions for
VSCode.  Mostly I just use codecov for viewing coverage.

## Reset day checklist
* run `cd packages/cli`, `dart run bin/reset.dart`
* run `cd packages/db`, `docker exec spacetraders_postgres /scripts/init_db.sh spacetraders`
* Update open_api_config.yaml to have the latest git hash.
* regenerate space_traders_api

### Generating `space_traders_api` package
```
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
dart pub global activate openapi_generator_cli
rm -rf packages/openapi/
openapi-generator generate -c open_api_config.yaml
rm -rf packages/openapi/test
dart pub -C packages/openapi get
dart format packages/openapi
git add packages/openapi
```
Then modified:
* Fixed handling of required num fields:
    * `packages/openapi/lib/model/jump_gate.dart`
  Due to: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/10637#pullrequestreview-1425351014

#### Bugs to report to OpenAPI
* Required arguments in request body should make body required/non-nullable.
  Example: RegisterRequest for POST /users/register
* The generated "enums" do not have equals or hashCode.  e.g. ShipRole.
  It doesn't end up mattering because they're singletons though.
* Generated toJson methods are not recursive (e.g. Survey.toJson doesn't call
  SurveyDeposit.toJson).
* Seems to lack anyOf support (GetSystemWaypointsTraitsParameter).
