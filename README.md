# Space Traders in Dart

Playing around with writing a Dart implementation of the Space Traders game.


## Usage

```
cd packages/space_traders_cli
dart run
```

Example output:

```
 dart run

## Other Dart Clients

The only other one I've seen is: https://crucknuk.itch.io/space-traders
But I've not seen the source for that and it appears to be v1 rather than v2.

### Bugs to report to OpenAPI
* Required arguments in request body should make body required/non-nullable.
  Example: RegisterRequest for POST /users/register
* The generated "enums" do not have equals or hashCode.  e.g. ShipRole.
  It doesn't end up mattering because they're singletons though.
* Generated toJson methods are not recursive (e.g. Survey.toJson doesn't call
  SurveyDeposit.toJson).

## Development

## Reset day checklist
* run `dart run bin/reset.dart`
* Update open_api_config.yaml to have the latest git hash.
* regenerate space_traders_api

### Generating `space_traders_api` package
```
dart pub global activate openapi_generator_cli
rmdir packages/openapi/
openapi-generator generate -c open_api_config.yaml
```
Then modified:
* rmdir packages/openapi/test directory since it was just TODOs.
* Fixed handling of required num fields:
    * `openapi/lib/model/jump_gate.dart`
  Due to: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/10637#pullrequestreview-1425351014
* Ran `dart format` on the generated code.

### Todo

Earning:
* Keep per-ship logs, so can calculate per-ship efficiency.
* Use recent earnings-per-second in ship behavior planning.
* Fix miners to know how to travel to nearby markets to sell.
* Fix miners to know when to leave a system (when prices are too low).
* Add logic for buying and mounting modules.
* Traders only consider how repeated buys inflate prices, they do not consider
  how repeated sells might deflate prices at sell point.
* Generate potential deals directly from PriceData with no server queries.
* Teach miners how to coordinate with haulers to sell their goods further away.

Exploring:
* Explorers should explore an entire system and then go to the jumpgate
  and then from the jump gate plan their next system.
* Probes should go sit at shipyards and marketplaces when there is nothing
  to explore.
* Buy an Explorer and teach it how to warp to other systems and other
  jump gate clusters.

Tech Debt:
* Build a docker container and run the app in the cloud.  With a docker volume
  so the state persists.
* Fix all uses of DateTime.now() to be DateTime.timestamp() and test.

Efficiency:
* Start to build a system database similar to the pricing database.
* Persist some of WaypointCache to disk.
* Make dart run .\bin\percentage_mapped.dart -v make zero requests.
* Write a better rate-limiting model.
* Make the script robust to network failures.
* Write generalized route planner to calculate route times and costs.

Automation:
* Have a config language to explain what mounts a ship should have.
* Have a config language to explain what the ships should be doing.
* Need to store handle and email somewhere.
* Need logic for planning which faction to be (random)?
* Logic for planning what to do with money (e.g. buy ships, by mods)
  Should disable buying behavior for less time early on?
* Surveys.  How much surveying should we do before we start mining?
* Add the ability to "queue" behaviors, so that when a ship pulls its next
  behavior it can pull from the queue.  This would allow us to queue a buyShip
  for a ship which was otherwise busy at the moment, for example?
* Teach ships when visiting ship-yards to ask the centralCommand if they
  should buy a new ship and then do so.

UI:
* Make shipInfo include an emoji for the behavior.
* Add a Flutter UI.
* Make it possible to filter for a sub-set of systems (e.g. ones with a market and a mine).
* Show where all ships currently are.
* Show which waypoints are charted vs. not.
* Show which systems have a market vs. not.
* Show which systems have a mine vs. not.
* Show which systems have a shipyard vs. not.
* Show which systems have a jump gate vs. not.

Thoughts
* Miners are just the "find me where to sell this" problem
* Contracts are just the "find me where to buy this" problem
* Arbitrage is both of those problems, should be able to share code.
