### Bugs to report to OpenAPI
* Required arguments in request body should make body required/non-nullable.
  Example: RegisterRequest for POST /users/register
* The generated "enums" do not have equals or hashCode.  e.g. ShipRole.
  It doesn't end up mattering because they're singletons though.
* Generated toJson methods are not recursive (e.g. Survey.toJson doesn't call
  SurveyDeposit.toJson).

## Development

## Reset day checklist
* run `dart run bin/reset.dart`
* Update open_api_config.yaml to have the latest git hash.
* regenerate space_traders_api

### Generating `space_traders_api` package
```
dart pub global activate openapi_generator_cli
rm -rf packages/openapi/
openapi-generator generate -c open_api_config.yaml
```
Then modified:
* `rm -rf packages/openapi/test` directory since it was just TODOs.
* Fixed handling of required num fields:
    * `packages/openapi/lib/model/jump_gate.dart`
  Due to: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/10637#pullrequestreview-1425351014
* Ran `dart format packages/openapi`

### Todo

Most impact:
* Park a probe at a shipyard to buy ships.
* Fix trading to understand low-volume trade prices.
* Be able to support miners across multiple systems.
* Be able to move miners between systems (squads).
* Make saving take less time (log rolling or db?), also avoids dataloss.
* Use MineJob to cache market and mine location (save lookups).

Early Game:
* Could ask the intial probe to sit still, or come back to buy ships for you.
  Currently that breaks because it doesn't have prices to buy from.
  Also breaks contract trading to not have price data.
  Could have it just explore the initial system and then go sit?
* Probe should probably stay close to the main system to help find trades?

Earning:
* Keep per-ship logs, so can calculate per-ship efficiency.
* Use recent earnings-per-second in ship behavior planning.
* Fix miners to know how to travel to nearby markets to sell.
* Fix miners to know when to leave a system (when prices are too low).
* Traders only consider how repeated buys inflate prices, they do not consider
  how repeated sells might deflate prices at sell point.
* Teach miners how to coordinate with haulers to sell their goods further away.
* Add refining
* Add gas siphoning
* Add logic for command ship to switch between trading and mining depending
  on expected profit.
* Buy traders when trading is more profitable than mining, and vice versa.
* Remove all use of maxJumps and use distance or maxWaypoints instead.
  Jumps will get the wrong answers in dense areas of the galaxy.
* Be able to buy miners outside of the main system.
* Add dedicated survey ships.
* Teach deal logic that price can move (even if just 1c) on each buy/sell lot.
* Calculate "wait time" when servicing a ship.
* Try changing deal finding heuristic to only consider buy price.
* Spread out traders across the galaxy better.
* buy-in-a-loop for small tradeVolumes gets worse as we have more ships.
  This is likely the #1 contributor to "wait time".
  Every place we return null to loop has the same problem.
* Record # of extractions per survey?  (Does laser power matter?)
* Record which ship generated a survey?
* Allow ships to buy from the same location at high trade volumes?
* Have one thread be generating instructions and another thread executing.
  When execution hits an error, just throw it back to the generator thread.
  Run each of the ships as separate "programs".
  Unclear if multi-threaded will work OK with json files.

Exploring:
* Explorers should explore an entire system and then go to the jump gate
  and then from the jump gate plan their next system.
* Probes should go sit at shipyards and marketplaces when there is nothing
  to explore.
* Buy an Explorer and teach it how to warp to other systems and other
  jump gate clusters.

Tech Debt:
* Fix all uses of DateTime.now() to be DateTime.timestamp() and test.
* Write a test suite for routing.
* Make all load/loadCached functions consistent.

Efficiency:
* Make dart run .\bin\percentage_mapped.dart -v make zero requests.
* Write a better rate-limiting model.
* Make the script robust to network failures.
* Teach route planner how to warp.

Automation:
* Have a config language to explain what mounts a ship should have.
* Have a config language to explain what the ships should be doing.
* Need to store handle and email somewhere.
* Need logic for planning which faction to be (random)?
* Logic for planning what to do with money (e.g. buy ships, by mods)
  Should disable buying behavior for less time early on?
* Surveys.  How much surveying should we do before we start mining?

UI:
* Make shipInfo include an emoji for the behavior.
* Add a Flutter UI.
* Make it possible to filter for a sub-set of systems (e.g. ones with a market and a mine).
* Show where all ships currently are.
* Show which waypoints are charted vs. not.
* Show which systems have a market vs. not.
* Show which systems have a mine vs. not.
* Show which systems have a shipyard vs. not.
* Show which systems have a jump gate vs. not.

Thoughts
* Miners are just the "find me where to sell this" problem
* Contracts are just the "find me where to buy this" problem
* Arbitrage is both of those problems, should be able to share code.

### Make sure multiple ships can work on a single contract:
deliver 96000 (95640 remaining) ALUMINUM_ORE to X1-ST5-23902F in 6d for 6,182,400c with 2,649,600c upfront
Expected profit: 3,840,000c

Maybe show the list of ships on it in the output?


## Redesign

Problem statement:
- Want to ensure that we always deliver reqeusts to the server on time.
- Want planning to be able to run ahead of execution.
- Would like a recorded form of planning to debug separate from execution.


Idea:
- Have an execution thread which cannot plan, can only execute instruction
  streams, one per ship.  Also knows how to schedule between instruction
  streams, both for dealing with yields/waits, but also priority.
- Have a planning thread which cannot execute, only compile to instruction
  streams which are sent over the to the execution thread.

Planner cannot talk to the network.

Executor cannot plan.

Need to write out an example plan in the instruction/action language.

Questions:
* How is state transfered between executor and planner?

# Planner loop
* Knows about priority?
* Sees an empty queue, plans for it.
* Works on projected state?
* Loops

# Executor loop
* Knows about priority.
* Knows about network cooldowns.
* Pulls a command from the queue.
* Executes
* On failure, marks queue as failed, flushes it?
* Sends state back to planner (or just updates a shared state via DB?)
