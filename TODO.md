### Todo

To sort:
* Record requests per-ship?  Calculate number of requests used per cycle?
* Confirm survey sizes have consistent extraction rates across trade symbols.
* Make shipInfo include an emoji for the behavior.

Earning:
* Keep per-ship logs, so can calculate per-ship efficiency.
* Use recent earnings-per-second in ship behavior planning.
* Be able to buy miners outside of the main system.
* Try changing deal finding heuristic to only consider buy price.
* Spread out traders across the galaxy better.
* Record which ship generated a survey and with what mounts?
* Allow ships to buy from the same location at high trade volumes?
* Make Survey selection find a value point and then look back further than
  the last 100 surveys for surveys above that value.
* Do we correctly navigate right away after the last jump?
* Use the closest ship to a shipyard when buying a ship.

Exploring:
* Explorers should explore an entire system and then go to the jump gate
  and then from the jump gate plan their next system.
* Probes should go sit at shipyards and marketplaces when there is nothing
  to explore.
* Buy an Explorer and teach it how to warp to other systems and other
  jump gate clusters.

Tech Debt:
* Write a test suite for routing.

Efficiency:
* Make the script robust to network failures.
* Teach route planner how to warp.

Automation:
* Need to store handle and email somewhere.
* Need logic for planning which faction to be (random)?
* Logic for planning what to do with money (e.g. buy ships, by mods)
  Should disable buying behavior for less time early on?

Thoughts
* Miners are just the "find me where to sell this" problem
* Contracts are just the "find me where to buy this" problem
* Arbitrage is both of those problems, should be able to share code.

## Teach late-start clients how to purchase traders instead of miners?

### Surveys
Miners will likely fight over surveys, probably all grabbing the "best"
survey and possibly exhausting it at the same time and having to restart
the mining operation?

### Add a /healthz cli and monitor it.

### Network Queue Exception?

### Change everything to support c/r in addition to c/s

* Create a new hauler behavior that sends haulers to mines to take goods.
* Teach Miners to decide whether to:
  * Sell local
  * Travel and sell
  * Transfer to a hauler
  * Jettison

If nothing else, each interval should be evaluted against the possibility of moving to sell?

### Log error rates from network executor

### Record minable traits with surveys

### Record surveyor type with surveys

### Remove MarketCache

### Divide Surveyors into squads and assign one squad per mine.

Once this is working can buy more of each.

### Add some sort of dynamic evaluation of the quality of a mine (every hour?)

### Keep per-ship action logs

### Be able to plan trades with less than full cargo.

### CostedDeal.limitUnitsByMaxSpend doesn't seem to fit under limit.

If you pass it 1000000, CostedDeal.expectedCosts will end up slightly
higher than that?

### Refactor sellAllCargo to only sell on lot at a time.

That way we can run our "where should we sell this" in between lots.

### Route planning is not aware of partial tanks of fuel.

If you don't have a full tank of fuel, it will plan a route that will
cause you to end up drifting, what it should do is plan an early refuel in it
and when it refuels re-set to a full capacity.

### Make sure construction handles completion correctly.

I'm not sure we have any guards for when construction is completed.

### Plan route through fails if the first leg eats all fuel.

e.g.
fuelCapacity: 100
A -> B = 100
B -> C = 1000 (so drift)
Try to plan [A, B, C] = fails but it should find a [DRIFT, DRIFT] route, or
if B has fuel, a [CRUISE, DRIFT] route.

I think this happened due to time skew with the server during Contact expiration.

Our local check though the contract was expired.  But the server didn't.

### Make MineSquad locations more dynamic

Should be possible with making scores more dynamic?

### Make Siphon Squads

### Remove auto-drifting.

Just clogs up trade routes.

### Confused hauler transfers

üõ∏#11 Hauler ESEIDEL-9 is IN_ORBIT to JX78-XF5X arrival -18m, with 0 space available.

11 is in orbit at X1-JX78-XF5X.  7 is in orbit at X1-JX78-XF5X.

I think this is due to miner haulers not running often? And thus not updating
their transit status?

### Construction doesn't seem to avoid over-buying.

If you disable the "avoid from same source" construction will buy multiple
times of the same final set of units for a contract.  e.g. if only 40 more
are needed, you'll still end up with two 40-sized trades going.

### Teach satellites to ignore exchange-only markets?

### Reduce manual construction of CostedDeal in tests.

### Teach extract_scores to consider jettisoning.

Try planning out various simulations for each mine and judge based on expected
total c/s? (or maybe c/r?) rather than median prices at the markets.

### Add a script to examine extract/market scores of a single market:

So I can better understand why we don't chose specific mining locations, e.g.
for a supply chain.

% dart run bin/exports_supply_chain.dart 
Sourcing FAB_MATS for AC35-I59
Shuttle FAB_MATS from AC35-F51 (SCARCE, RESTRICTED) to AC35-I59 (no market) distance = 449
 Manufacture FAB_MATS at AC35-F51 (SCARCE, RESTRICTED)
  Shuttle IRON from AC35-H55 (SCARCE, RESTRICTED) to AC35-F51 (LIMITED, GROWING) distance = 90
   Manufacture IRON at AC35-H55 (SCARCE, RESTRICTED)
    Extract IRON_ORE from AC35-C43, deliver to AC35-H55 (SCARCE, GROWING) distance = 158
  Extract QUARTZ_SAND from AC35-C43, deliver to AC35-F51 (SCARCE, WEAK) distance = 229

This might be fixed by considering jettisoning goods.

### Support jumping when the other side of the gate is uncharted.

The client doesn't seem to do this right now.  But did do so once I ran the
jumpgates.dart script.

### Waypoint cache is not using maxAge.

We should be scanning a system before we travel to it.  But right now we
don't respect the maxAge so we'll think it's always uncharted.

### Slow server can break client.

### Check if we artificially devalue fuel trades

We include fuel price at destination when evaluating trades.  But if we're
trading fuel we don't want to do that. We could refuel from cargo and the price
is also going to change as part of our delivery.

### Write a script to profile deal finding across multiple systems.

### Do I consider cost when moving to another system for trading?

### Add limit for how long low-value deals can go.

e.g. 7hr for 1c/s isn't worth it.  But 30m for 1c/s might be.
7hr for 7c/s is fine.

### Make the idle queue resume where it left off.

### canJump should always use a cached version?

### Make it possible for ships other than command to buy ships.

Command ship can get stuck on many hour trades and then not be able to buy
new ships even after they're queued.

### Prefer shorter trades over longer at the same c/s?

Would only need to apply to trades at low c/s.

### Bring back phases.

- Some sort of initial phase (plan trades based on import/export?)
- Ramping up to a certain number of traders.
- Focusing on construction
  (Need to fix supply chain logic to handle entire chains.)
- Ramping up probes + exploring
  (Don't buy probes before opening the jump gate, or they'll start
  system watching instead of charting.)
- Turning off mining and replacing with heavy freighters.

### Assign miner haulers only when a miner is active at the assigned waypoint.

### Write logic to predict how long until current behavior is resolved.

### Logic to find the closest ship to a waypoint (for task start).

### Write a script to predict cash flow.
* Can us the "when done" logic to predict when we sell inventory.
* Can use the historical data for miners.

### Add a system for managing cash-flow to avoid missing trades from low cash.

### Mining Haulers still confused:

üõ∏#E  Still have 12 cargo, waiting for hauler to arrive.
üõ∏#E  No haulers at TV94-B44, unknown next arrival time for ESEIDEL-6, checking in 1 minute.
üõ∏#E  Hauler ESEIDEL-6 is IN_ORBIT to TV94-B44 arrival -30m, with 0 space available.

### Make sure that hauler routes are cruise-able with the given hauler.

### Script for tracking construction.

Lists current status of the construction.
Lists any in-progress construction deals.
Lists status of construction supply chain?

### Teach ships how to refuel from cargo.

That way miner haulers can bring fuel with them when heading to a mine and then
refuel there, so they have enough to get back to the market.

### Gate probe buying off of # of uncharted systems?

e.g. when we know of 10 uncharted systems by 1 probe? up to a limit?
Could do similar with trades? Buy N haulers when we have N available trades?
And maybe mining?  When we have N available mines with score above x?

### Should disable jumping (for charters at least?) when low on cash?

### Making trades w/o prices would help early game (and for new systems).

### Regenerate connectivity every time we chart a jumpgate.

Presumably just a bool on centralCommand that the outer loop can check/clear.

Need two things:
1. A way to know that we should re-gen.
2. A list of jumpgates to add?  (Or do we just re-start the scan?)
  If we add a single jump gate we'd want to know it's distance?
  Or do we just not care and call it 0 each time?

### Set up a siphoner on each gas giant?  Maybe an ORE_HOUND + Siphoner?

Turns out we need squads too since the closest hydrocarbon market is an exchange
rather than an import.

### Use systems.json to find all the systems with lots of markets.

I suspect that "home systems" look different only by types / number of waypoints.

### Planning fail.

### Move logs into db.

### Add explorer/warp logic.

- Generate a list of places to warp to.
- Model how long warping takes:
https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs/wiki/Travel-Fuel-and-Time
- Plan a route to the warp point (which may include jump gates)?

### SystemWatcher should clear after every visit, even if it's already charted.

### Replace findBetterTradeLocation with something cheaper.

Probably have some logic which computes the number of trades available
per-system, and then reassigns ships to the closest system with available trades?

Maybe more generally we should be computing how many traders a given system
can handle and re-balancing our traders accordingly?  Similar to what we do
with system-watchers?

### Predict prices before purchase and log when they differ?

### Profile and improve speed of idle_queue.dart

### Write a script to distribute traders.

### Write logic to pick a place to buy a ship and then the closest/fastest ship to buy there.

### Remove MarketPrices from cache (significant load time).

### Add warp time/fuel prediction.

My theory is this happens when we do top of loop in between when the ship was

How does it end up with a second buy job?

### Assign unsused probes.

Each system can have "slots" based on the number of connected systems without charts.
Assign up to half the slots?
Do some sort of proximity based matching?

Currently probes (and traders) do self-assign which can cause probes to "grab"
far-away systems, even though a closer probe would have done better.

Same thing could work for traders.  Compute the number of deals above a
certain c/s, starting from that system and assign up to a certain capacity
level with a similar matching algorithm?

### finish warp pathing.

Pre-compute the path to jumpgate and path from jumpgate.
And add those costs as costs to beginning or ending with a jump.
If those costs are passed into the warp planner the planner will then correctly
choose to warp small distances to adjacent systems to cross large distances
within a system.  It also simplifies the inter-system planning since
we don't have to modify actions after the fact, we just pass in costs to
the planner?

### Unify warp planner into waypoint planner?

- Add warp planner.
- Add logic for explorers to go to more systems (via warp).

### Move constructionSellOpps, etc. onto a ConstructionState object?

### Fix Refuel navigation to actually work (see TODO in navigation.dart)

### Move constructionSellOpps, etc. onto a ConstructionState object?

### Squads.dart not listing haulers?

It (and all other scripts) aren't setting up the Config phase correctly.
Should make config a getter, and have it log if the phase isn't set.
