Map TODO
* Make it possible to filter for a sub-set of systems (e.g. ones with a market and a mine).
* Show where all ships currently are.
* Show which waypoints are charted vs. not.
* Show which systems have a market vs. not.
* Show which systems have a mine vs. not.
* Show which systems have a shipyard vs. not.
* Show which systems have a jump gate vs. not.

Goal
* Move to the top of the rankings.
* Have an app which looks pretty.

Problems I'm solving

* How much has been spent on X, Y, Z?
* Why is it earning so slowly?
* What are all the ships doing?
* What is each ship earning?
* What is the current status of Gate?
* Why is the gate building taking so long?
* How far has been explored?
* How long until the gate is completed?
* Which system is the most profitable?
