# space_gen
Simple, hackable Open API generator for Dart

This is not designed to be a full implementation of OpenAPI.  Currently
just enough to generate beautiful Dart bindings for spacetraders.io.

Patches welcome to expand it to support a wider set of OpenAPI.

## Usage

dart run space_gen

## Values
* Generates good quality, modern Dart code.
* Gives readable errors on failure.
* Generates much, but not all, of OpenAPI 3.0.
* Generates independent classes, which can be used in pieces.
* Supports immutable output.
* Generates testable code.

## Design
* Parses the Spec, including recording JSON pointer locations and inferring model names.
* Resolves all references and loads resulting urls in the cache.
* Walks the parsed spec and renders to files using templates.

## Todo
* Generate tests. https://github.com/eseidel/space_gen/issues/1
* Handle min/max in newtype types.
* Wire up Authentication and sending of bearer header.
* OpenAPI defaults arrays to empty when optional? including Market.exchange.

## Advantages over Open API Generator 7.0.0
* Dart 3.0+ only (sound null safety)
* Model code round trips through JSON correctly (TBD)

## Why not just contribute to OpenAPI?

As of August 2023, there are two separate (soon to be combined?) OpenAPI
generators for Dart.  One for package:http and one for package:dio.  I only
ever used the http one and it had lots of bugs.  I looked at fixing them
in OpenAPI, but failed to figure out how to hack on the OpenAPI generator
(Java) or successfully interact with the community (several separate slacks).
