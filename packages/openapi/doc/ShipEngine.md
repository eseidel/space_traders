## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**symbol** | **String** | The symbol of the engine. | 
**name** | **String** | The name of the engine. | 
**description** | **String** | The description of the engine. | 
**condition** | **num** | The repairable condition of a component. A value of 0 indicates the component needs significant repairs, while a value of 1 indicates the component is in near perfect condition. As the condition of a component is repaired, the overall integrity of the component decreases. | 
**integrity** | **num** | The overall integrity of the component, which determines the performance of the component. A value of 0 indicates that the component is almost completely degraded, while a value of 1 indicates that the component is in near perfect condition. The integrity of the component is non-repairable, and represents permanent wear over time. | 
**speed** | **int** | The speed stat of this engine. The higher the speed, the faster a ship can travel from one point to another. Reduces the time of arrival when navigating the ship. | 
**requirements** | [**ShipRequirements**](ShipRequirements.md) |  | 
**quality** | **num** | The overall quality of the component, which determines the quality of the component. High quality components return more ships parts and ship plating when a ship is scrapped. But also require more of these parts to repair. This is transparent to the player, as the parts are bought from/sold to the marketplace. |
